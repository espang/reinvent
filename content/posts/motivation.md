# Motivation

The reason for writing this blog is manifold. My main reasons are:

Firstly, I am a programmer and only have a basic understanding of computer systems. Working on content for this blog should widen my horizon.

Secondly, I was never very good at writing. If you want to improve a skil you have to use it! I hope by writing this blog my writing style improves.

Thirdly, there are many projects I want to do but only few I actually start and even fewer that I finish. This blog is here to keep a log of my work and should keep me motivated to work on it.

Time will show if I succeed with my goals. The idea of the blog is exploring existing software systems and understand how they work. I genuily enjoy writing software so I will learn about them by reimplementing small parts of them. The content will cover small program examples, testing and benchmarking those. I might even write post about protocols like http or termonology like process or socket. But the main part should be around reimplementing. I will start with a client for (NATS)[https://nats.io/]. This will allow to have a closer look at using TCP to communicate over the network. All projects will be public available on (githu
)[https://github.com/espang].
